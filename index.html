  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <div class="card">
    <p>
      I specialize in designing large-scale automation systems, orchestration layers, 
      and resilient test engineering frameworks. With deep experience in backend automation, 
      distributed test architecture, cloud-native validation platforms, and end-to-end quality systems, 
      I focus on building frameworks that scale across teams, environments, and marketplaces.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am also strongly focused on AI-driven automation. I actively work on leveraging LLMs, 
      autonomous agents, and AI-assisted quality engineering to accelerate system validation, 
      reduce engineering effort, and introduce self-healing test ecosystems.
    </p>

  <h2>Portfolio: System Designs</h2>

  <div class="card">
    <div class="design-title">1. Distributed Orchestration Layer for Queue-Based Order Processing</div>
    <p>
      Designed an orchestration engine that consumes orders from SQS/Kafka, performs fan-out API calls with retries, 
      fallbacks, circuit breakers, and consolidated response mapping. Built for high throughput and horizontal scalability.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <div class="design-title">2. Unified Automation Framework for Multi-Marketplace Shadow Runs</div>
    <p>
      Created a modular shadow framework supporting ingestion normalization, distributed execution, and transaction-level 
      comparisons across System1/System2. Introduced data filtering and configuration decoupling to reduce setup time.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <div class="design-title">3. AI-Augmented Failure Classification Engine</div>
    <p>
      Developed an LLM-powered classification engine that analyzes failures, clusters patterns, and suggests root causes. 
      Integrated with CI pipelines for continuous learning and triage automation.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <div class="design-title">4. Scalable API Test Harness for Microservices</div>
    <p>
      Architected a test harness capable of running parallel contract tests, chaos scenarios, data-driven validation, 
      and real-time metrics aggregation.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <div class="design-title">5. Cloud-Native Automation Grid</div>
    <p>
      Built a Kubernetes‑based Selenium/Grid cluster with auto-scaling nodes, service mesh routing, and on-demand test environments.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <div class="design-title">6. Intelligent Test Impact Analysis System</div>
    <p>
      Designed a system that maps code changes to test suites using dependency graphs + ML predictions, enabling selective execution 
      and reducing test cycles by 80–90%.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2>AI Enthusiasm</h2>
  <div class="card">
    <p>
      I actively integrate AI into engineering workflows: autonomous test agents, natural-language-driven frameworks, dynamic data 
      generation, and predictive stability scoring. My goal is to build next-generation automation ecosystems where tests adapt, heal, 
      and evolve using AI.
